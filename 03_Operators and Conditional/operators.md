# Different Types of Operators in C++

C++ provides a variety of operators that are used to perform operations on variables and values. These operators are categorized as follows:

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus)

## 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare two values:
- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

## 3. Logical Operators
Used to perform logical operations:
- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

## 4. Bitwise Operators
Operate on bits and perform bit-level operations:
- `&` (Bitwise AND)
- `|` (Bitwise OR)
- `^` (Bitwise XOR)
- `~` (Bitwise NOT)
- `<<` (Left shift)
- `>>` (Right shift)

## 5. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables:
- `=` (Assign)
- `+=` (Add and assign)
- `-=` (Subtract and assign)
- `*=` (Multiply and assign)
- `/=` (Divide and assign)
- `%=` (Modulus and assign)

## 6. Increment and Decrement Operators
Used to increase or decrease the value of a variable:
- `++` (Increment)
- `--` (Decrement)

## 7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Used to evaluate a condition and return a value:
- `? :` (Condition ? True : False)

## 8. Special Operators
- `sizeof` (Returns the size of a data type)
- `typeid` (Returns the type of an expression)
- `&` (Address-of operator)
- `*` (Pointer dereference operator)

## 9. Other Operators
- `,` (Comma operator)
- `->` (Member access through pointer)
- `.` (Member access)
- `::` (Scope resolution operator)

These operators are fundamental to writing efficient and effective C++ programs.

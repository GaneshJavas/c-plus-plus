# INTRO
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

# DIFFERENCE
Difference between C and C++
    C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

    The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.

C++ is a powerful language that offers several advantages over C:

Performance: C++ is generally faster than C, especially for tasks that require high performance.
Memory Management: C++ provides automatic memory management, which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.
Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.
Standardization: C++ is part of the C++ standard library, which provides a set of classes and functions that can be used to develop applications.

# FEATURES
C++ offers several features that make it a powerful language for developing applications:

Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.
Platform-Independence: C++ is platform-independent, which means that the same code can be compiled and run on different platforms without modifications.
Memory Management: C++ provides automatic memory management, which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.
Statically Typed: C++ is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable is determined at compile-time.
Speed: C++ is generally a faster language, especially for tasks that require high performance.
Pointers and References: C++ supports pointers and references, which allow for more efficient memory management and manipulation.

# COMPILER
C++ compilers are software tools that are used to compile C++ code into machine code that can be executed by a computer. Some popular C++ compilers include:

GCC: GCC is a popular open-source C++ compiler that is used to compile C++ code on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.
Clang: Clang is a popular open-source C++ compiler that is used to compile C++ code on macOS and other Unix-like operating systems.
MSVC: MSVC is a popular open-source C++ compiler that is used to compile C++ code on Windows.

## DATA TYPES
# Primitive
    => Basic data types that are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold and stores in memory.

    int: This is a signed integer data type that can hold values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
    float: This is a floating-point data type that can hold values with a precision of 6 decimal places.
    double: This is a floating-point data type that can hold values with a precision of 15 decimal places.
    char: This is a character data type that can hold a single character.
    bool: This is a boolean data type that can hold either true or false.
    void: This is a data type that is used to indicate that a function does not return a value.

    short: This is a signed integer data type that can hold values from -32768 to 32767.
    long: This is a signed integer data type that can hold values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
    long long: This is a signed integer data type that can hold values from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
    unsigned char: This is an unsigned integer data type that can hold values from 0 to 255.
    unsigned short: This is an unsigned integer data type that can hold values from 0 to 65535.
    unsigned int: This is an unsigned integer data type that can hold values from 0 to 4294967295.
    unsigned long: This is an unsigned integer data type that can hold values from 0 to 4294967295.
    unsigned long long: This is an unsigned integer data type that can hold values from 0 to 18446744073709551615.
# Derived
    => Adding features to Primitive Data type i.e., datatypes derived from  other datatypes

    Array: Collection of similiar datatypes. An array is a sequence of objects of the same type that occupy a contiguous area of memory.
    Function: A function is a block of code that performs some operation.
    Pointer: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object.
    Reference: A reference, like a pointer, stores the address of an object that is located elsewhere in memory. Unlike a pointer, a reference after it's initialized can't be made to refer to a different object or set to null. 

# User-Defined
    => Data types that are defined by the user.

        Struct : The struct keyword defines a structure type and/or a variable of a structure type.
        Union : A union is a user-defined type in which all members share the same memory location.
        Enum : An enumeration is a user-defined type that consists of a set of named integral constants that are known as enumerators.
        Class : The class keyword declares a class type or defines an object of a class type.
        Typedef : a typedef is a keyword used to create an alias for an existing data type.
